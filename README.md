*CORD-19 Research Dataset Analysis*

*Overview*

This project analyzes the CORD-19 research dataset using Streamlit, a popular data science framework. The goal is to provide insights into the dataset and create interactive visualizations to facilitate exploration.

*Features*

- Data loading and exploration
- Interactive visualizations:
    - Bar chart of publications by year for selected authors
    - Histogram of publication years
    - Bar chart of top authors
- Insights into the dataset, including:
    - Number of rows and columns
    - Column names
    - Top 5 years with the most publications for selected authors
    - Most common publication year

*Requirements*

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

*Usage*

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib`.
3. Run the code using `streamlit run app.py` (assuming your file is named `app.py`).
4. Interact with the visualizations and explore the dataset.

*Code Structure*

The code is well-structured and follows best practices. The main sections include:

- Data loading and exploration
- Streamlit app creation
- Visualization and insight generation
